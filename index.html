            <p> My name is David Demian. I am 28 years old. I was born in Texas,USA and raised in Cairo,Egypt. I moved back to
                the US when I was 21 years old. I studied computer science in Egypt but when I moved here, I figured that
                I had to start from the scratch. So I decided to find a job and keep my school aside. I worked too many job.
                I started as a security office in LA then a cashier at a gas station in AZ then sales representative for
                Nestle USA in VA then account manager for Pepsico and now I am a specialist at the Apple Store.</p>
            <p>I decided to work at Apple because I always had passion for technology and computers and I was thinking about
                going back to school.</p>
            <p>I was introduced to the coding bootcamp by a coworker at apple who took it and just graduated couple of weeks
                ago. I always had passion for coding and I never felt bored of it. That's why I decided to take the bootcamp.</p>
